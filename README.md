## plants n' stuff
* [azolla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla) - mosquito control, nitrogen fixer
* duckweed - edible
* [eddie's aquarium centre](https://www.eddiesaqua.com/)
* mealworm frass will feed both plants and bugs

## the tank
* aquarium with an LED grow light on top (also a clear plastic lid perhaps)
* plants grown on styrofoam "island" with [3D printed net pots](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:438476)
* [aerator bubbler](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:594277)
* grow plants out of the top of the tank
* may need to raise pH (eggshells may work)
* filter may be required to remove extra sediment (but pump may not need to be run all the time like a conventional aquarium)
